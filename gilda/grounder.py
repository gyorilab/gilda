    ----------
    terms :
        Specifies the grounding terms that should be loaded in the Grounder.

        - If ``None``, the default grounding terms are loaded from the
          versioned resource folder.
        - If :class:`str` or :class:`pathlib.Path`, it is interpreted
          as a path to a grounding terms gzipped TSV file which is then
          loaded. If it's a str and looks like a URL, will be downloaded from the internet
        - If :class:`dict`, it is assumed to be a grounding terms dict with
          normalized entity strings as keys and :class:`gilda.term.Term`
          instances as values.
        - If :class:`list`, :class:`set`, :class:`tuple`, or any other iterable,
          it is assumed to be a flat list of
          :class:`gilda.term.Term` instances.
    namespace_priority :
        Specifies a term namespace priority order. For example, if multiple
        terms are matched with the same score, will use this list to decide
        which are given by which namespace appears further towards the front
        of the list. By default, :data:`DEFAULT_NAMESPACE_PRIORITY` is used,
        which, for example, prioritizes famplex entities over HGNC ones.
